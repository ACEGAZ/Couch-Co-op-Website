 # Testing 
 
  * I have tested that the website works in Chrome, Firefox and Edge 
  * I have tested that the website is responsive in dev tools and when manually resizing the browser window. 
  * I have tested that the fonts, font sizes and background colours are all easily readable. 
  * I have tested that the form will only work if all fields are filled and that the submit button works.

  # Solved Bugs

  * Device tool bar in dev tools did not accurately represent the size of the web page, causing elements to move when the browser was resized. this was solved by manually resizing the browser window and ajusting elements. 

  # Unsolved bugs

  * Font Awesome icons move to the right when the browser is refreshed.
  * font size rules not allows being followed for mobile scrrens in Chrome browsers. 

  # Validator testing
